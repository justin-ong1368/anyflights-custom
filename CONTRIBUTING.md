# Contributing

Contributions to `anyflights`, whether in the form of bug fixes, issue reports, 
new code or documentation improvements are encouraged and welcome. Of 
particular interest is increasing unit testing coverage, checking supplied
arguments more thoroughly, and getting generated data packages to pass 
`R CMD CHECK` in a variety of edge cases.

Maximal goofiness in commit messages and description of issues/PRs, including 
but not limited to emojis, excessive punctuation (!!!), or ridiculous 
capitalization is encouraged but not required. 

Please use snake case (such as `get_flights`) for function names.
Besides that, in general follow the 
[tidyverse style guide](http://style.tidyverse.org/) for R.
